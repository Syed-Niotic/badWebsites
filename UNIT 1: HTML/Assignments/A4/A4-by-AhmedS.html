                    The document head is where you define the title of your page, 
                    include information about your page for search enginges like Google, 
                    load style sheets and occasionally load JavaScript files <q>though for 
                    performance reasons, it's preferable most of the time to load JavaScript 
                    right before the end <code> &lt;/BODY&gt; </code> tag at the bottom of your 
                    page.</q><sup>1</sup>

                    A title cannot contain any formatting, HTML, 
                    images, or links to other pages. Castro and Hyslop note 
                    the importance of the title:
                    <blockquote>
                        In most browsers, the title appears in the title bar of the browser. 
                        It also appears on the page's tab in browsers that support tabbed browsing.
                        The title also shows in your visitor's browser history lists and bookmarks. 
                        Perhaps more importantly, the title is used by search engines to get a sense
                        of your page's content and typically as the link that appears in their search
                        results.<sup>2</sup>
