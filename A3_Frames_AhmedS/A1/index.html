             I'm Syed Ahmed, and this is my pawn Website. 
             I work here with my old man and my son, Big Zuhab. 
             Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 17 years 
             - you never know what is gonna come through that door.
             
             I was born and raised in Dubai, U.A.E . At the age of 5 I made the great journey of a 18 hour flight to Canada.
             Once in canada, I prused the lifestyle of an average boy; attending school, sleeping, and being an annoyance.
             at the age of 13 I discovered the power of memes.
             By the crisp age of 16, I was already a top-level memer. I found myself at the top of my game.
             I could dish out memes on demand. But with great power, also came great responsibility. 
             I realised by then, I was a role model to many people in many countries. Soon I developed a sense of undying commitmeny to the community.
             I pioneered the recipe to concoct word salad. The community appraised for me for my research. By the time the reach age of 17, I was able
             to make word salad for a party of 20 people without even 1 person recognizing the word salad. At this time. I was truly proud. :)
